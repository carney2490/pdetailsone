# Personal Details

This was my first endeavor into utilizing sinatra and html

Sinatra is a free and open source software web application library and domain-specific language written in Ruby. It is an alternative to other Ruby web application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Merb, Nitro, and Camping. It is dependent on the Rack web server interface. http://www.sinatrarb.com/

  - The task was to gather personal information about the user (name, age, and favorite numbers) and then do some basic math with the information and display it in a web app.
